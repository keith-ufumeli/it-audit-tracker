IT Audit Trail Tracker – Requirements Document

1\. Introduction

The IT Audit Trail Tracker system will enhance transparency, accountability, and security by systematically recording and monitoring user activities across critical IT systems. It provides authorized personnel—Audit Managers, Auditors, and Management—with tools to create and assign audit tasks, track progress, and review system-generated logs.

The system captures detailed activity logs (logins, file access, configuration changes), ensures logs are timestamped and securely stored, provides role-based access, and enables collaboration between stakeholders. It includes automated triggers, alerts, and secure document handling to improve audit efficiency.

2\. User Roles and Permissions

Audit Managers

\- Initiate audits and define scope.

\- Assign tasks to Auditors.

\- Track progress of audit assignments.

\- Generate detailed and summary reports.

\- Review findings and provide feedback.

Auditors

\- Access system logs relevant to their assigned audits.

\- Submit audit reports directly through the system.

\- Request documents from Departments.

\- Receive, review, and manage departmental documents.

\- Flag suspicious activities for escalation.

Management

\- View high-level summaries and dashboards.

\- Provide feedback on audit reports.

\- Approve or reject audit outcomes.

Clients

\- Receive email notifications triggered by system events (will simulate email notifications).

\- Respond via secure client portal.

Departments

\- Receive requests for documents from Auditors.

\- Upload requested documents securely into the system.

3\. Portal Architecture

The system will include two main portals within the same Next.js codebase, managed by role-based access control:

Admin Portal

Accessible to Audit Managers, Auditors, and Management. Provides dashboards, audit management, reporting, and activity monitoring features.

Client Portal

Accessible to Clients and Departments. Provides simplified views for responding to audit-related communications, uploading requested documents, and receiving updates.

Both portals share the same backend and database, with role-based routing enforced through Next.js middleware. This allows easier maintenance, consistent design, and efficient scaling.

4\. Core Functional Requirements

\- Audit Task Management: Create, assign, and monitor audit tasks with defined start and end dates.

\- Audit Reporting: Auditors can draft, edit, and submit reports within the system.

\- Document Request \& Handling: Secure requests and uploads with version control.

\- Activity Logging: Automatic recording of key events (logins, file access, changes).

\- Notifications \& Alerts: Email and in-app notifications with suspicious activity alerts.

\- Reports \& Dashboards: Detailed audit reports, management dashboards, and export options.

\- Security \& Compliance: RBAC, encryption, backup and archiving functions.

5\. Non-Functional Requirements

\- Performance: Handle concurrent access efficiently.

\- Scalability: Support growth in users and logs without performance degradation.

\- Security: Encrypted storage, secure authentication (MFA/SSO), compliance with GDPR/ISO.

\- Usability: Intuitive UI with responsive design (Next.js + Tailwind/Shadcn).

\- Availability: 99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms.

\- Maintainability: Modular architecture for easy updates and enhancements.

6\. Technical Stack (Proposed)

\- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS V3, ShadCN, TypeScript.

\- Backend: Next.js API routes.

\- Database: Simulate a real database using JSON files.

\- Authentication: NextAuth.js with role-based access.

\- Notifications: WebSockets for in-app alerts.

\- Deployment: Vercel 

7\. Future Enhancements

\- AI-assisted anomaly detection in logs.

\- Integration with third-party compliance tools (e.g., ISO audit frameworks).

\- Mobile app support for Auditors and Management.

\- Customizable workflow engine for different audit types.
